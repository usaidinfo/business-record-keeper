## CouchDB Sync Configuration ðŸ”„

The app uses CouchDB for data synchronization with the following setup:

1. Local Database: RxDB with in-memory storage
2. Remote CouchDB Server: `https://your-couch-server.com`
3. Sync Configuration:
   - Two-way replication
   - Real-time sync on data changes
   - Conflict resolution using timestamp-based strategy

## Offline Functionality ðŸ“±

The app implements a robust offline-first architecture using RxDB and AsyncStorage:

### How it Works:

1. **Local Data Storage**
   - All data is stored locally using RxDB (in-memory database)
   - AsyncStorage is used for persistent storage
   - Every change is immediately saved locally

2. **Data Persistence Layer**
   - Business and article data are automatically saved to AsyncStorage
   - Data persists even when the app is closed
   - Automatic loading of data when app restarts

3. **CRUD Operations**
   - Create: New businesses and articles are saved instantly
   - Read: Data is read from local storage
   - Update: Changes are saved immediately
   - Delete: Removals are processed locally

4. **Implementation Details**
   - Uses RxDB for efficient data handling
   - AsyncStorage for permanent storage
   - Automatic synchronization between RxDB and AsyncStorage
   - Custom hash function for data integrity

### Key Features:

- âœ… Works without internet connection
- âœ… Instant data updates
- âœ… Data persistence across app restarts
- âœ… Efficient data querying
- âœ… Automatic state management

The offline functionality ensures that users can:
- Add new businesses and articles
- View all stored data
- Update existing records
- Delete records
- All without requiring an internet connection
